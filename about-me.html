                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        <p>I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Aerospace Engineering. Although I'm engineering-oriented, my goal is
                        to spur social change. I aspire to actively collaborate with other inventors to build influential tech companies, and I want to use my platform to draw attention
                        to issues that matter. Firstly, I want to inspire more girls to pursue STEM careers and to create their own doors of opportunities. ALso, I want the next generation to
                        believe that anything is possible. With technology and innovation continuously breaking the barriers of our imagination and capabilities, it's true that quite
                        anything is possible nowadays. However, there are many problems that are deemed "impossible," preventing people from opening their minds and putting in
                        the resources and effort to solve those problems. This means that issues such as carbon emission and suboptimal waste elimination remain unsolved. If an entire
                        generation can think past the improbable to collaborate and tackle these "impossible" problems, then many issues in the world will likely be solved. In particular,
                        I personally want to help India and other third world countries solve sanitation and waste problems. My goal is to help save lives of people who die and are effected
                        by related diseases. I am also passionate about helping the world become cleaner and more sustainable. Aware of the magnitude of my dreams, I am currently pursuing
                        aerospace engineering, so if anything changes, well, at least I can say that I'm doing rocket science :P</p>

                        <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
                        <p>I was born in Kolkata, India and moved to the United States when I was one. I've lived in Massachusetts all the way until college, so coming to Texas was a big step for me.
                        As an only child, it was, and is continually, a challenge to live without my parents nearby because they're my whole world. But it's also taught me a lot about myself as
                        an individual and has really opened my eyes to just how important my family is to me and how much they've shaped me into the person I am today. I've had the privilege to
                        have my parents as my best friends, but to also have them to look up to as role models in assimilating into American culture. As immigrants, I've watched them adapt to American
                        society and simultaneously immerse themselves more into Indian culture. They've inspired me through their sacrifice and have taught me the importance of identity and integrity,
                        and they have defined the ambitious, assertive, grounded person I am today. </p>

                        <span></span>
                        <h2>Who am I personally?</h2>
                        <p>Outside of focusing on building my career and being a student, I also am an actual person (surprise!). My senior year, I had to do a 100-hour project for my school, in
                        which I hand-stitched a quilt of numerous shirts I had acquired through school, events, and extracurriculars I've participated in throughout my life. That introduced me to
                        sewing, which I realized I really love. I enjoy making things (which is why I am pursuing an engineering degree), and sewing embodies a creative side that isn't
                        found in building technology. Although I didn't have the time for it during the semester, I went home and sewed my Christmas dress, which was my first time sewing something
                        wearable. After really enjoying that entire process, I hope to someday buy myself a sewing machine so that I can sew my own clothes at home. Otherwise, like anyone else,
                        I spend my time hanging out with my friends. I love playing cards, particularly Fish (aka Literature), and watching movies during my free time to destress and relax a little. </p>
